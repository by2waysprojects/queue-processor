# **🚦 Load Management System in Go with Redis**

Welcome! This project is a **load management system** built in **Go**, designed to limit the number of requests to a service within a specified time frame. 🎟️ Initially developed for queue management in ticket sales, its flexible design makes it suitable for a variety of use cases where request rate control is crucial. 🚀

---

## **✨ Key Features**

- **⚙️ Efficient Request Management:**
  - Controls the maximum number of requests allowed within a specific time window.
  - Prevents system overload and ensures smooth user experiences.

- **📦 Redis-based State Management:**
  - Uses Redis for fast and reliable centralized state storage.
  - Optimized for distributed systems and high-performance workloads.

- **📈 Horizontal Scalability:**
  - Designed for seamless scaling in modern architectures like Kubernetes.
  - Supports multiple instances with consistent state sharing via Redis.

- **🛠️ Fault Tolerance:**
  - Built to gracefully handle partial failures without disrupting service.

- **🌍 Versatility:**
  - Useful for a variety of scenarios, including:
    - 🛡️ Protecting against brute force attacks.
    - 🔗 Controlling access to shared resources.
    - ⏳ Managing high-demand queues, such as ticket sales.

---

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**

- **💻 Programming Language:** Go (Golang).
- **📊 Database:** Redis, serving as the centralized store for state and counters.
- **☸️ Infrastructure Compatibility:** Kubernetes and other container-based environments.

---

## **🚀 How It Works**

1. **🔍 Request Handling:**
   - Each request is identified using an IP address, token, or other unique identifier.

2. **⏳ Rate Limiting:**
   - Verifies how many requests have been made during the configured time frame.
   - Denies excess requests with an HTTP `429: Too Many Requests` response.

3. **🔄 Distributed Synchronization:**
   - Ensures consistent state sharing across nodes using Redis.

4. **🛡️ Resilience:**
   - Handles failures gracefully, including temporary Redis outages or node crashes.

---

## **📦 Use Cases**

1. **🎟️ Queue Management:**
   - Prevents system saturation during high-demand events like ticket sales.

2. **🛡️ Rate Limiting:**
   - Protects public and private APIs from abuse by controlling request rates.

3. **🔗 Shared Resource Management:**
   - Guarantees fair access to resources in distributed systems.
